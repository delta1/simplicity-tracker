Simplicity is a typed, combinator-based, functional language without loops or recursion. It is formally verified, and can be statically analyzed with upper bounds on computation resources prior to execution. Simplicity has the desirable property of being Turing incomplete, but can express any finitary function. Simplicity is the next generation in smart contract scripting.

## Development

- install nodejs 22.12+ or just run `nix-shell` if you have Nix
- install deps `npm ci`
- start vite with `make` (or `npm run dev`)
